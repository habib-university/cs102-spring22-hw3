        "We know graphs are used to represent pair-wise relationships - such as friendship. When we use graphs to represent social relationships then we call them social graphs (aka [social networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network)) - such as friendship graphs to represent a friendship relation among a group of people. Similarly, we can use graphs to represent [technological networks](https://www.sci.unich.it/~francesc/teaching/network/technological.html) (such as Power Grid and Internet), [biological networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_network) (such as [food web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_web) and [protein-protein interactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein%E2%80%93protein_interaction), [transport networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_network_analysis)(airline and roads networks), and many more kinds of networks. Did you notice the usage of graphs in different domains? \n",
